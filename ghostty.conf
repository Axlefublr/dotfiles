#
# This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
# fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the primary
# font. This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts,
# etc.
#
# The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
# explicitly set. If a style is not set, then the regular style (font-family)
# will be searched for stylistic variants. If an italic style is not found,
# Ghostty will auto-italicize the regular style by applying a slant. If
# a bold style is not found, Ghostty will look for another monospace
# font.
#
# You can disable styles completely by using the `font-style` set of
# configurations. See the documentation for `font-style` for more information.
#
# If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a fallback,
# specify the value as `""` (empty string) to reset the list and then set the
# new values. For example:
#
    # font-family = ""
    # font-family = "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"
#
# Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
# values set in configuration files so you don't need to specify
# `--font-family=""` before setting a new value. You only need to specify
# this within config files if you want to clear previously set values in
# configuration files or on the CLI if you want to clear values set on the
# CLI.
#
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.

# will be disabled. If the running program in the terminal requests a disabled

#
# To disable programming ligatures, use `-calt` since this is the typical

#   * modifiers and keys can be in any order, `shift+a+ctrl` is *weird*,
#     but valid.
#
#   * only a single key input is allowed, `ctrl+a+b` is invalid.
#
#   * the key input can be prefixed with `physical:` to specify a
#     physical key mapping rather than a logical one. A physical key
#     mapping responds to the hardware keycode and not the keycode
#     translated by any system keyboard layouts. Example: "ctrl+physical:a"
#
# Valid modifiers are `shift`, `ctrl` (alias: `control`), `alt` (alias: `opt`,
# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
#
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
#
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
#
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable.
#
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
#
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
#
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
#
# Some notes for the action:
#
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire
#     trigger/action in double quotes. Example: `--keybind="up=csi:A B"`
#
# There are some additional special values that can be specified for

#     removes ALL keybindings up to this point, including the default

# function and the available uniforms match Shadertoy. The iChannel0 uniform
# is a texture containing the rendered terminal screen.
#
# If the shader fails to compile, the shader will be ignored. Any errors
# related to shader compilation will not show up as configuration errors
# and only show up in the log, since shader compilation happens after
# configuration loading on the dedicated render thread.  For interactive
# development, use [shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com).
