This is my helix configuration!

`config.toml` is generated using `generator.py`, and is intentionally not checked in to make line-by-line staging nicer for me.

This *does* make it harder for you to get my exact config, fwiw: you need to *somehow* install the python `toml` library.

I'm on arch so I just `sudo pacman -S python-toml`, on non arch you'd `pip install toml` probably?

I'm not using `venv` here because I still don't know how that works.

And after all that, the config that's generated won't work for you, lol.

That's because I forked helix! \
To use my config, you also need to be using [my fork](https://github.com/Axlefublr/helix).
